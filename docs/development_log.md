**Log Entries (Newest First):**

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for these actions)*
*   **Goal:** Implement architectural refactor, moving state update determination from Gamemaster to a dedicated State Manager LLM.
*   **Input Context:** Previous architecture where Gamemaster suggested state updates, leading to confusion and incorrect behaviour. User request to refactor based on a GM -> Content -> State Manager -> Apply Updates flow.
*   **Discussion & Actions:**
    *   **Gamemaster Refinement:** Modified `prompts/gamemaster_system.txt` and `gamemaster.py` to remove all responsibility for suggesting state updates. Role focused solely on assessment (`odds`) and outcome flavor text (`success_message`, `failure_message`). Enhanced prompt to demand better contrast between success/failure messages and strict adherence to inventory context.
    *   **State Manager Integration:**
        *   Imported `translate_interaction_to_state_updates` into `main.py`.
        *   Loaded `prompts/state_manager_system.txt`.
        *   Modified `main.py` loop to call `translate_interaction_to_state_updates` *after* content generation (narrative/dialogue), passing player input and LLM response text.
        *   Modified `main.py` loop to pass the State Manager's generated updates (not the Gamemaster's) to `apply_state_updates`.
    *   **Prompt Alignment & Debugging:**
        *   Fixed `KeyError: 'player_utterance'` by removing the placeholder from `prompts/dialogue_system.txt`.
        *   Corrected `start_dialogue` parameter name (`target_id` vs `character_id`) mismatch between `main.py::apply_state_updates` and `prompts/state_manager_system.txt`.
        *   Removed unnecessary `stop_processing_flag` from successful `start_dialogue` in `main.py`.
        *   Refined State Manager prompt (`prompts/state_manager_system.txt`) to improve outcome awareness (checking for failure in LLM response) and clarify parameter formatting (`update_relationship`).
*   **Created Documentation:** Generated `architecture_overview.md` detailing the new flow and listing next steps.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Modified `main.py`, `gamemaster.py`, `prompts/gamemaster_system.txt`, `prompts/state_manager_system.txt`, `prompts/dialogue_system.txt`. Created `architecture_overview.md`. Updated `docs/development_log.md` (this entry).
*   **Decision:** Adopted the new State Manager-centric architecture.
*   **Current Status:** Core loop follows the intended architecture. Gamemaster role is streamlined. State Manager is responsible for update determination. Several issues identified in testing remain.
*   **Next:** Address outstanding issues, primarily the `LocationManager` bug and further State Manager prompt refinements.

*   **Next:** Implement actual API calls in `game_v0.py`.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Verify basic API connectivity before implementing calls in main game logic.
*   **Input Context:** User agreement to test connectivity first.
*   **Discussion:** Created temporary script `api_test.py` to load credentials from `.env` and make minimal calls to both Anthropic and Google AI APIs. Installed necessary libraries (`python-dotenv`, `anthropic`, `google-genai`).
*   **Affected Files/State:** Created `api_test.py`. Updated project dependencies (via pip).
*   **Decision:** Proceed with running the test script.
*   **Next:** Run `api_test.py` and analyze results.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Confirm basic API connectivity.
*   **Input Context:** Previous decision to test connectivity before implementation.
*   **Discussion:** Ran `api_test.py`. Received successful 'Hello' responses from both Anthropic (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and Google AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro), confirming keys and model access are working. Deleted `api_test.py` as per protocol.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Ran `api_test.py`. Deleted `api_test.py`.
*   **Decision:** Basic API connectivity verified.
*   **Next:** Research advanced API features (multi-turn, structured output, etc.) before implementing calls in `game_v0.py`.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Process user-gathered Google AI API info and update documentation.
*   **Input Context:** User provided `docs/human_gathered_api_info_google` file.
*   **Discussion:** Read the provided document. Identified key relevant features: multi-turn Chat object, configuration parameters (temp, tokens, etc.), system instructions, vision/code execution potential. Critically noted the likelihood of a Function Calling/Tool Use feature being superior to our planned `<state_update>` JSON method, requiring further investigation. Updated `docs/api_notes_google.md` with these findings.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Read `docs/human_gathered_api_info_google`. Updated `docs/api_notes_google.md`.
*   **Decision:** Prioritize investigating function calling/tool use features for state updates before implementing the JSON parsing method.
*   **Next:** User to provide similar gathered info for Anthropic API.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Process user-gathered Anthropic API info and revise state update strategy.
*   **Input Context:** User provided `docs/human_gathered_api_claude` file.
*   **Discussion:** Read the provided document. Identified key relevant features: multi-turn via `messages`, `system` prompt parameter, **Tool Use mechanism**, streaming, config params, vision. Confirmed Tool Use is the preferred method for state updates, replacing the previous JSON block parsing plan. Updated `docs/api_notes_anthropic.md` with findings. Updated `docs/intent_v0.md` (Section 5) to reflect the strategic shift to Tool Use.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Read `docs/human_gathered_api_claude`. Updated `docs/api_notes_anthropic.md`, `docs/intent_v0.md`.
*   **Decision:** Adopt Tool Use/Function Calling as the primary mechanism for LLM-driven state updates.
*   **Next:** Implement actual API calls in `game_v0.py`, starting with `call_claude_api` and incorporating the Tool Use handling logic.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Implement Claude API Tool Use handling in `game_v0.py`.
*   **Input Context:** Refined understanding of Tool Use flow, previous implementation of basic `call_claude_api`.
*   **Discussion:** Agreed on the need for a new state update function (`apply_tool_updates`) tailored to the tool schema and a response handler (`handle_claude_response`) to manage the two-call process for tool invocation. Decided to omit the `tools` parameter on the second call.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Modified `game_v0.py`: Added `apply_tool_updates` and `handle_claude_response` functions. Updated the `main` loop to use the new handler. Removed the old `parse_and_apply_state_updates` and `_apply_updates_internal` functions. Updated Section 5 of `docs/intent_v0.md` to reflect the implementation details.
*   **Decision:** Proceeded with implementing the core Tool Use handling logic.
*   **Next:** Test the implementation, refine prompts to encourage tool use, implement history management, and integrate Gemini.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Implement conversation history management for Claude.
*   **Input Context:** Working game loop with Tool Use handling.
*   **Discussion:** Implemented basic history by passing recent messages back to Claude. Modified `construct_claude_prompt` to accept history, `call_claude_api` to use it (with simple truncation), and `main` loop to manage the history list. Discussed limitations of simple truncation and the potential for future enhancements (Summarization, RAG) for better long-term memory, deciding to defer these more complex approaches.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Modified `game_v0.py` (main loop, call_claude_api, construct_claude_prompt, handle_claude_response). Updated `docs/intent_v0.md` (Section 3) to note current approach and future work on context management.
*   **Decision:** Proceed with simple truncation for V0 history management; document need for future enhancements.
*   **Next:** Test history implementation. Refine prompts or add other features.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Implement and debug enhanced dialogue tools (item exchange, relationship updates).
*   **Input Context:** Successful test of character generation and basic dialogue initiation. Decision to proceed with adding dialogue interaction tools.
*   **Discussion & Actions:**
    *   **Defined Tools:** Added `exchange_item_tool` and `update_relationship_tool` schemas to `config.py`.
    *   **Enabled Tools in Dialogue:** Modified `dialogue.py::handle_dialogue_turn` to include the new tools in the list passed to the LLM API call.
    *   **Updated Dialogue Prompt:** Significantly revised `prompts/dialogue_system.txt` to:
        *   Include placeholders for character context (inventory, trust score, statuses).
        *   Provide detailed descriptions and usage guidelines for all three dialogue tools (`end_dialogue`, `exchange_item`, `update_relationship`).
        *   Instruct the LLM on how character state should influence behavior and tool use.
    *   **Added Context Fetching:** Modified `dialogue.py::handle_dialogue_turn` to fetch inventory, trust, and status data using `CharacterManager` and format it for the prompt placeholders.
    *   **Implemented Tool Handling:** Added `elif` branches in `main.py::handle_claude_response` to process calls to `exchange_item_tool` and `update_relationship_tool`, extracting parameters and calling the relevant (initially placeholder) `CharacterManager` methods.
    *   **Implemented Character Manager Methods:** Implemented the core logic for inventory (`add_item`, `remove_item`, `has_item`) and relationship methods (`update_trust`, `set_status`, `remove_status`, `decrement_statuses`) in `character_manager.py`.
    *   **Implemented Item Exchange Logic:** Added logic in `main.py::handle_claude_response` for `exchange_item_tool` to handle transfers involving both player inventory and `CharacterManager` methods, including checks and basic rollback attempt.
    *   **Debugging Dialogue Errors:** 
        *   Fixed `IndexError` in `dialogue.py::handle_dialogue_turn` caused by redundant prompt formatting after context insertion.
        *   Escaped `{}` -> `{{}}` in prompt examples (`prompts/dialogue_system.txt`) to prevent formatting errors.
        *   Fixed `KeyError: 'content'` in `dialogue.py::handle_dialogue_turn` by correctly accessing `"utterance"` when building API message history.
        *   Fixed `NameError` in `main.py::handle_claude_response` by adding missing imports for `exchange_item_tool` and `update_relationship_tool` from `config.py`.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Modified `config.py`, `dialogue.py`, `main.py`, `character_manager.py`, `prompts/dialogue_system.txt`, `docs/development_log.md` (this entry).
*   **Decision:** Proceeded with implementing and debugging the core logic for dialogue-driven item exchange and relationship updates.
*   **Current Status:** Dialogue system includes tools for ending conversation, exchanging items, and updating relationships. Core logic for processing these tools and updating state via `CharacterManager` is implemented. Dialogue prompts provide context (inventory, trust, status) and tool usage instructions. Basic functionality appears stable after debugging.
*   **Next:** Thorough testing of the new dialogue tools (item exchange variations, trust changes, status effects). Further prompt refinement based on testing.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Debug character generation and dialogue initiation, confirm tool usage.
*   **Input Context:** Previous tests showed Claude failing to use `create_character` tool appropriately and dialogue failing due to `NameError` and incorrect character ID usage.
*   **Discussion & Actions:**
    *   **Fixed `NameError`:** Added missing import for `DEBUG_IGNORE_LOCATION` in `main.py`.
    *   **Refined Prompt Instructions:** Further strengthened instructions in `prompts/claude_system.txt` to more clearly guide Claude on when to use `create_character` (especially for player-initiated summons) versus `update_game_state`.
    *   **Removed Old NPC Handling:** Removed `current_npcs_add/remove` fields from `update_game_state_tool` schema (`config.py`) and the corresponding handling code from `narrative.py::apply_tool_updates` to prevent confusion and enforce usage of `CharacterManager`.
    *   **Testing:** Successfully tested the character generation flow. Player action intended to summon a character correctly triggered Claude to use the `create_character_tool`. Subsequent attempt to initiate dialogue with the newly generated character using their name correctly triggered Claude to use the `start_dialogue` tool with the *exact* `character_id` provided by the `CharacterManager`.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Modified `config.py`, `narrative.py`, `main.py`, `prompts/claude_system.txt`, `docs/development_log.md` (this entry).
*   **Decision:** Confirmed character generation and dialogue initiation tools are functioning correctly with the `CharacterManager` and refined prompts.
*   **Future Work / Note:** The `DEBUG_IGNORE_LOCATION` flag is a temporary measure. A more robust location management system will be needed in the future to handle character presence based on actual game world locations, at which point this flag should be set to `False` or removed.
*   **Current Status:** Core character management (creation, storage, basic retrieval) and dynamic generation via LLM tool calls are functional. Dialogue can be initiated with generated characters. Location checks are temporarily bypassed for testing.
*   **Next:** Proceed with implementing the enhanced dialogue mechanics (item exchange, relationship updates) using the `CharacterManager`'s placeholder methods.

**[Date - Placeholder] - Character Manager V1 Implementation**

**Context:** Decision to implement a CharacterManager module for better organization and scalability before adding enhanced dialogue features.
