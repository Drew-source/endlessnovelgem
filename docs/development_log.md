*   **Decision:** Adopt Tool Use/Function Calling as the primary mechanism for LLM-driven state updates.
*   **Next:** Implement actual API calls in `game_v0.py`, starting with `call_claude_api` and incorporating the Tool Use handling logic.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Implement Claude API Tool Use handling in `game_v0.py`.
*   **Input Context:** Refined understanding of Tool Use flow, previous implementation of basic `call_claude_api`.
*   **Discussion:** Agreed on the need for a new state update function (`apply_tool_updates`) tailored to the tool schema and a response handler (`handle_claude_response`) to manage the two-call process for tool invocation. Decided to omit the `tools` parameter on the second call.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Modified `game_v0.py`: Added `apply_tool_updates` and `handle_claude_response` functions. Updated the `main` loop to use the new handler. Removed the old `parse_and_apply_state_updates` and `_apply_updates_internal` functions. Updated Section 5 of `docs/intent_v0.md` to reflect the implementation details.
*   **Decision:** Proceeded with implementing the core Tool Use handling logic.
*   **Next:** Test the implementation, refine prompts to encourage tool use, implement history management, and integrate Gemini.

**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:** *(Timestamp for this action)*
*   **Goal:** Implement conversation history management for Claude.
*   **Input Context:** Working game loop with Tool Use handling.
*   **Discussion:** Implemented basic history by passing recent messages back to Claude. Modified `construct_claude_prompt` to accept history, `call_claude_api` to use it (with simple truncation), and `main` loop to manage the history list. Discussed limitations of simple truncation and the potential for future enhancements (Summarization, RAG) for better long-term memory, deciding to defer these more complex approaches.
*   **Affected Files/State:** Modified `game_v0.py` (main loop, call_claude_api, construct_claude_prompt, handle_claude_response). Updated `docs/intent_v0.md` (Section 3) to note current approach and future work on context management.
*   **Decision:** Proceed with simple truncation for V0 history management; document need for future enhancements.
*   **Next:** Test history implementation. Refine prompts or add other features.

    *   Migrated narrative functions (`apply_tool_updates`, `construct_claude_prompt`, `handle_narrative_turn`) to `narrative.py`.
    *   Reconstructed `main.py` with core loop, API init, central response handling (`handle_claude_response`), I/O, and orchestration logic.
    *   Added necessary inter-module imports.
    *   **Debugging:** Initial testing revealed missing prompt files (`summarization.txt`, `dialogue_system.txt`) and premature dialogue termination.
        *   Identified cause: Missing files, incorrect filename (`summarization_template.txt` vs `summarization.txt`), hardcoded system prompt in `dialogue.py`, inconsistent history truncation, incorrect `summarize_conversation` signature/call.
        *   Requested user create/rename prompt files.
        *   Fixed `handle_dialogue_turn` to use loaded template.
        *   Fixed `utils.py` history truncation to use config constant.
        *   Fixed `summarize_conversation` definition and call site in `dialogue.py`/`main.py`.

*   **Affected Files/State:** Created `docs/dialogue_engine_summary.md`. Updated `docs/project_structure.md`.
*   **Decision:** Add dedicated summary document for the dialogue engine.
*   **Next:** Proceed with planned refactoring of `game_v0.py`.

**[Date - Placeholder] - Dialogue Exit & History Fixes Complete**

**Context:** Following the reset to a stable state where dialogue entry worked, the focus was on enabling dialogue exit and fixing the history inconsistency that caused errors when returning to narrative mode after tool use.

**Actions & Decisions:**

*   **Dialogue Exit Enablement:**
    *   Modified `handle_dialogue_turn` to pass `tools=[end_dialogue_tool]` to `call_claude_api`, allowing the LLM to trigger conversation endings.
    *   Changed `handle_dialogue_turn` to return the raw `response_obj` instead of processed text.
    *   Updated the `main` loop's dialogue branch to call `handle_claude_response` to process the raw response, enabling tool detection.
    *   Refined the dialogue branch logic to update the character's specific dialogue history *only* if the `end_dialogue` tool was not used (checked via `stop_processing_flag`).
*   **History Correction (Tool Use Sequence):**
    *   Modified `handle_claude_response` to return a more detailed 5-tuple: `(processed_text, initial_response_obj, tool_results_content_sent, final_response_obj_after_tool, stop_processing_flag)`.
    *   Updated both dialogue and narrative branches in `main` to unpack these 5 values.
    *   **Critically redesigned the history update logic in the *narrative* branch:** Ensured that after an assistant message containing `tool_use` (for *any* tool like `start_dialogue`, `end_dialogue`, or `update_game_state`), a user-role message containing the corresponding `tool_result` block(s) is immediately appended to the main `conversation_history`. This resolved the API error related to mismatched tool use/result sequences.
    *   Ensured the narrative branch uses the `stop_processing_flag` to correctly skip Gemini calls during dialogue transitions.
*   **Testing:** Confirmed successful execution of the full narrative -> dialogue entry -> exchange -> dialogue exit -> narrative continuation cycle. Verified that character memory (dialogue history) persists correctly between separate conversations.

**Current Status:**

*   The core narrative and dialogue engines are functioning correctly.
*   Transitions between narrative and dialogue modes (both entry and exit) are working reliably via tool use.
*   Character-specific dialogue history persists and influences conversation.
*   The main conversation history correctly handles the sequence of tool use and results, preventing API errors.
*   **The primary goals for the dialogue system (V1 as per design doc) are now met.**

**Next Steps:**
*   Further testing and refinement of prompts (especially dialogue prompts for naturalness and reliable tool use).
*   Consider potential edge cases or minor improvements.
*   Plan next major feature development (e.g., more complex state interactions, richer world).
