# Location Generator Prompt

## Your Task:
Given the current location ID/description, known adjacent locations, and a narrative summary, generate plausible new location IDs and descriptions for **ALL FOUR cardinal directions (North, East, South, West)**. Aim to create locations that are not only geographically plausible but also offer **narrative potential** aligned with the `narrative_summary` and current situation.

## Input Format:
You will receive:
*   `current_loc_id`: The ID of the location you are generating neighbors for.
*   `current_loc_desc`: The text description of the current location.
*   `known_connections_context`: Text describing already connected locations.
*   `narrative_summary`: A brief summary of recent game events and the overall story context.

## Output Requirements:
*   **Output ONLY a valid JSON object.** No extra text.
*   The JSON object **MUST** contain **EXACTLY FOUR** keys: `"north"`, `"east"`, `"south"`, `"west"`.
*   For each of the four direction keys:
    *   Consider the `narrative_summary` and `current_loc_desc`. Generate an ID and description that fits the context and could lead to interesting gameplay (e.g., if the summary mentions pursuit, a generated location might be a good hiding spot or an ambush point; if it mentions ancient ruins, a generated location could be related).
    *   If `known_connections_context` shows a connection exists, you can reference it, but ensure the key is still present.
    *   If the direction is NOT mentioned in `known_connections_context`, you MUST generate:
        *   `"id"`: A **unique**, descriptive location ID (lowercase, underscores) reflecting the narrative potential (e.g., `shadowy_figure_trail`, `abandoned_watchtower`).
        *   `"desc"`: A brief (1-2 sentence) evocative description hinting at the location's relevance to the story or potential events.
    *   If a direction is impassable, provide an ID/description for the boundary, making it narratively consistent if possible (e.g., `rockslide_blockage_north`).
*   Ensure generated descriptions are consistent.

## Example Input:
```
current_loc_id: forest_path_section_3
current_loc_desc: A winding path through dense forest. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the canopy.
known_connections_context: North leads to 'forest_path_section_2' (A slightly more open section of the path.).
narrative_summary: The player is searching for a lost artifact rumoured to be in an old ruin deep in the forest.
```

## Example Output (JSON Only) - MUST contain exactly N, E, S, W keys, considering narrative:
```json
{
  "north": {
    "id": "forest_path_section_2", 
    "desc": "(Known Connection) A slightly more open section of the path."
  },
  "east": {
    "id": "overgrown_ruin_wall", 
    "desc": "Eastward, crumbling moss-covered stones rise from the undergrowth - perhaps part of the ruin?"
  },
  "south": {
    "id": "ancient_mossy_bridge",
    "desc": "The path leads south to an ancient, moss-covered stone bridge crossing a small, murky stream."
  },
  "west": {
    "id": "hidden_game_trail",
    "desc": "To the west, a barely visible game trail branches off, potentially a shortcut deeper into the woods."
  }
}
```
